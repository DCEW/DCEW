I am a medical statistician/health data scientist with a background in academia and clinical veterinary work.  I am currently Principal Disease Intelligence Analyst within the National Disease Registration Service at NHS England, where I am health inequalities lead and a Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP) advocate. I am also analytical lead for the [National Cancer Quality of Life Survey](https://digital.nhs.uk/ndrs/our-work/ncras-work-programme/cancer-quality-of-life-survey), and I contribute to, and lead, a number of other analytical programmes, including national and international data exchanges, methodological explorations and others. I deliver training and produce materials to advance the use of RAP principles in NDRS and the wider NHSE, and sit on the steering group of the NHSE-R users group.

My chief interests lie in:
- RAP adoption
- Quality analysis for actionable insights in healthcare
- Health inequality reduction
- Supporting the adoption of cutting edge analytical and technological advances for health data analysis
